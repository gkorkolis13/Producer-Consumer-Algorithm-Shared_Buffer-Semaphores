# Producer-Consumer-Algorithm-Shared_Buffer-Semaphores
Mini project for my Operating Systems Course. We were instructed to create the producer-consumer algorithm including a shared buffer. Goal was for the producer to read data from an input file, and then insert the extracted data onto the shared buffer. The consumer then checks if shared buffer is available to take from it, and then it inserts the retrieved data onto an output file.
